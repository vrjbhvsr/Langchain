    "\n",
    "* Chains are components that connect different parts of a workflow together. For example, in the previous files, when I created a prompt, I had to manually call `prompt = template.invoke()` and then pass it to `model.invoke(prompt)`. Chains allow us to link these steps together seamlessly, so the output of one component automatically becomes the input to the next — without having to handle each step separately.\n",
