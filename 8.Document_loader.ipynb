      "Electrical stimulation (ES) is a prominent area of research in regenerative medicine, particularly regarding its effects on bone tissue and cells. Since the discovery of bone's piezoelectric properties in 1957, it has been recognized that mechanical strain in bone generates electric fields that influence healing processes, such as bone deposition and the differentiation of osteoblasts. Living cells have a negative membrane potential due to ion transport, which can be influenced by external electric fields. In response to bone injuries, a wound potential is created to recruit precursor cells for healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research suggests that ES can affect various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Common methods for applying ES involve direct contact stimulation, where electrodes transmit current to cultured cells. This stimulation can alter cell membrane potential and trigger intracellular pathways, influencing calcium ion dynamics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which play roles in cellular function and stress response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus of the study is on the effects of short alternating current (AC) stimulation on human osteoblasts using specified parameters. The impact of ES on intracellular calcium levels, cell adhesion, and morphology was analyzed over 24 hours, with an additional investigation into whether ES influences cells through liquid mediums, specifically using pre-conditioned cell culture media. The conditions of the medium, including pH, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide content, were also examined.\n"

      "39 NarrativeText A widespread research ﬁeld in regenerative medicine is electrical stimulation (ES), and its impact on tissue and cells, such as bone [1]. In 1957 the piezoelectric properties of bone were described [2]. As the bone healing process takes place under the mechanical strain of the bone [3], an electric ﬁeld is generated in the bone in vitro and in vivo [4]. Externally applied electric ﬁelds were shown to contribute to bone deposition and osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [5]. The living cell has a membrane potential that indicates the electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space, which is generated by the transport of ions through ion channels and ion transporters [6]. The membrane potential is always negative because of the higher negative ion concentration inside the cell [7,8]. Primary osteoblasts revealed a membrane potential of −60 mV [9], MG- 63 osteoblasts demonstrated a negatively charged cell surface of −15.6 mV [10]. Due to the appearance of ions and polar or charged molecules, cells can build up electrical ﬁelds or can respond to them [11,12]. If injuries appear on the bone, a wound potential, which should lead precursor cells to differentiation, will be generated [13]. A possible approach for the\n",

      "44 NarrativeText therapy is through electrical stimulation to accelerate bone healing. In some publications, it is described that ES can manipulate different cell processes, for example, cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and differentiation [8,14]. Widespread methods of the ES for bone tissue are invasive methods like direct contact stimulation [14], in vitro, the electrically conductive electrodes are placed directly in the culture medium. The applied current streams from the anode to the cathode [15]. The modiﬁcation of the cell membrane potential through ES can activate different intracellular pathways. External electrical ﬁelds can generate an intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) ﬂow and consequently activate different pathways [16], such as wnt [17]. Ca2+ dynamics were identiﬁed as a sensitive parameter for cell physiological processes. Furthermore, the ES can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can control different cellular processes like proliferation and modulated signaling pathways [18,19]. When the equilibrium is destroyed, and the concentration of ROS is relatively high, cells suffer under oxidative stress. Moreover, Ca2+ signaling was shown to contribute to ROS generation through calmodulin [20], as well as ROS contributing to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations by altering calcium channels [21].\n",
      "45 NarrativeText It was described that the electric ﬁeld could modulate cell functions in order to accelerate wound healing and bone regeneration [5,12,14]. In contrast to previous studies, we are focusing on the inﬂuence of a short alternating current (AC)-stimulation time on settling cells via a commercial device (IonOptix) with the following parameters: rectangular waveform, voltages of ±1 or ±5 V, frequency of 7.9 Hz with pulse duration of 10 ms, or 20 Hz with pulse duration of 3.6 ms. In vitro, cell processes such as intracellular Ca2+ level and mobilization, adhesion, and morphology of human osteoblasts within 24 h were studied to understand the effect of ES on osteoblast behavior. In addition, we wanted to shed light on the question of whether ES affects the cells via liquids, i.e., AC-pre-conditioned medium. For these cell experiments, solely the cell culture medium was stimulated in the IonOptix chamber and analyzed for pH, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide content.\n",

      "51 NarrativeText The stimulation chamber C-Pace EM 100 is a multi-channel stimulator that enables the alternating current (AC)-stimulation of cells in an incubator. The electrodes are designed for a 12-well plate (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), and reach down to the bottom of the wells. This way, all cells can be electrically stimulated. The electrodes consist of carbon in the graphite modiﬁcation and are shaped in a plate format (capacitor). The advantages of graphite are its excellent electrical conductivity and the high resistance against corrosion. The protein adsorption on the surface is problematic as it affects the electrical ﬁeld´s homogeneity. Therefore, a regular cleaning after use is necessary [22]. The electrodes can be sterilized by treatment with ethanol and ultraviolet light (UV). The space between both plate electrodes amounts to 1.1 cm, and the wetted area in a well of the 12-well plate totals 0.42 cm2 when 1 mL ﬂuid is in the well (Figure 1b). To always establish identical conditions of the experiments, coverslips (Menzel™ Microscope Coverslips, Ø 18 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) were placed on each bottom of the 12-well plate.\n",

In the case of a different voltage difference, the solution can be linearly scaled. We used the ﬁnite element method for our computations, implemented in the open-source package EMStimTools (https://github.com/j-zimmermann/EMStimTools/releases/tag/ v0.1.4.dev0; accessed on 27 July 2022) [24]. The geometry of a single well was used and represented by a 2D model. The 2D representation corresponds to a slice through the geometry at a certain height and the top view, respectively.\n",
      "63 Title 2.3. Current Measurement\n",
      "64 NarrativeText The electrodes of the 12-well plate are arranged in a 4 × 3 matrix such that individual wells can be addressed sequentially by applying the stimulation voltage to the respective row and column, see Figure 1c. Current measurement was accomplished via a shunt resistor (R = 1 Ω) inserted into each column, enabling the sequential measurement of all four wells in the same column. An instrumentation ampliﬁer with variable gain and high bandwidth (up to 500 kHz) was used to precisely convert the differential shunt voltage drop to a single-ended output voltage. The stated currents corresponded to the peak values of the time-dependent signal.\n",

      "66 NarrativeText To eliminate the possibility that the electric ﬁeld inﬂuences the medium alone and thus inﬂuences the cell physiology, the medium parameters temperature, pH, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content were analyzed. For temperature, pH, and oxygen, fresh Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom FCS Superior, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and 1% gentamicin (Ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany) was exposed to ES for 10 min in a 12-well plate (1 mL per well). These parameters were measured in the middle of the liquid volume in the incubator at 37 ◦C, and 5% CO2 in triplicate: (i) temperature with the device Mini-K (Dostmann, with temperature gauger for Type K probes by testo), (ii) pH with a pH meter (Sentron SI series pH meter, SI400-010; Sentron Europe BV, Leek, The Netherlands), and (iii) oxygen with a needle-shaped optical oxygen microsensor (Oxygen micro-optode, type PSt1; Presens) connected to the Microx TX3 (Presens).\n",

      "73 NarrativeText The cell biological investigations were performed with human osteoblast-like cells MG-63 (passage number 5 to 30, ATCC® CRL-1427™, Manassas, VA, USA) [25]. The MG- 63s represent a well-established osteoblast model due to the similar characteristics in terms of cell spreading, adhesion, and signaling properties as primary human osteoblasts [25–27]. The MG-63s were cultivated in complete DMEM (with pyruvate, Thermo Fisher; 10% FCS; see Section 2.4.) at 37 ◦C in an incubator with 5% CO2. To obtain suspended cells for the experiments, cells were trypsinated (0.05% trypsin-EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Australia), collected in a complete medium and centrifuged (13,000× g, 4 ◦C, 5 min; Eppendorf 5702R; Hamburg, Germany).\n",
      "74 Title 2.6. AC-Activated Medium and Online Monitoring of Cell Adhesion\n",
      "75 NarrativeText To solve the question of whether the electrostimulation effects on cells are mediated via the liquid, the medium alone was AC-activated. For long-time cell adhesion and spreading, the xCELLigence RTCA (Real-time Cell Analysis) S16 instrument (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) was used [28]. The impedance-based assay determines the ion environment at the microelectrode/solution interface. The system displays the impedance in an arbitrary unit—Cell Index, which is determined by the cell-microelectrode impedance minus the baseline-impedance (medium without cells).\n",
      "76 NarrativeText The E-plate VIEW 16 (ACEA Biosciences, similar to 96-well format) was pre-incubated in an incubator at 37 ◦C for 2 h before the experiments started [29]. The complete DMEM was ﬁrst exposed to AC electric ﬁelds for 10 min. Then, MG-63s (10,000 cells/well) were seeded into the E-plate in 200 µL of the appropriate AC-stimulated medium. The impedance change caused by cell adhesion, and spreading was measured continuously at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 up to 24 h every 8 min. Data were analyzed using RTCA Data Analysis Software 1.0. The software calculated the slope of the cell adhesion over time, the Cell Index value after 24 h (Max Cell Index), and the adhesion rate (Cell Index at the time point when 50% of the cells adhere). MG-63s long-time adhesion was presented for ﬁve independent experiments.\n",
      "77 Title 2.7. AC stimulation of Cells and Initial Adhesion\n",
      "78 NarrativeText The question arose whether cells in suspension are already activated by AC and thus their adhesion behavior is altered. To hold the cells (1 × 106) in suspension, MG-63s were shaken (ThermoMixer C; Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) in a complete medium at 300 rpm at 37 ◦C. For the initial adhesion approach, 40 µL of suspended MG-63s was seeded into one well (12-well plate) containing a coverslip, electrodes were placed, and ES was started. After 10 min, 300 µL of the non-adherent MG-63s in the supernatant were counted by the ﬂow cytometer FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) using CellQuest Pro 4.0.1 (BD) software for data acquisition. The number of adherent osteoblasts was calculated in percent relative to the cell number at 0 min (suspended cells without adhesion on glasses). A new seeding of MG-63s with different ES parameters was performed every 10 min within a series of approaches with the same cell vial. Initial adhesion assays were performed seven times in independent experiments.\n",

Fluo-3/AM consists of molecules with two free binding sites that display an increase in ﬂuorescence in the presence of free Ca2+.\n",
      "88 NarrativeText MG-63s in a near conﬂuent state (70–80%) were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and centrifuged (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf AG). Next, 2 × 106 cells/2 mL were then resuspended in complete medium DMEM with shaking at 37 ◦C (ThermoMixer C). For every experiment, 2.5 × 105 cells from this pool were rewashed and centrifuged, and the cell sediment was stained with ﬂuo-3/AM (5 µM) in slightly hypotonic 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)- 1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [31], with shaking at 37 ◦C. After 40 min, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 250 µL of isotonic HEPES (formulation described in [32]). Next, 750 µL of isotonic HEPES was added to a 12-well plate (glass bottom, Cellvis, Mountain View, CA, USA), the stained suspended cells were added, and stimulation was started immediately. After 10 min, AC stimulation was stopped, and electrodes were removed. Both, during stimulation and after the 10 min AC stimulation, time series visualized the calcium signal of MG-63s using an LSM780 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany, argon ion laser at 488 nm) with a C Apochromat 40× water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, 1.20 W Korr M27). The acquisition of the Ca2+ signal was made using Zen2011 (black edition, Carl Zeiss, Jenna, Germany). The ﬁrst time series during stimulation included 150 cycles every 2 s, whereby the Ca2+ signal was recorded upon stimulation after a 5 min settling phase of the cells. After the 10 min AC stimulation, the electrodes were removed, and the second time series was started with 240 cycles at 2 s intervals, whereby after the 90th cycle, 10 mM adenosine-50-triphosphate (ATP; SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany; dissolved in PBS) was added. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) analysis was evaluated with Zen2012 software (blue edition, version 2.0.0.0, Carl Zeiss). The mean ROI for 10 deﬁned areas of individual cells for each time point (240 cycles = 240 time points) was determined. In preliminary experiments, the cell areas went out of focus after approximately 60 s AC stimulation (not in Controls), so only the ﬁrst 30 cycles could be evaluated. At least 6 independent experiments were analyzed to see the inﬂuence of AC stimulation on calcium–ion dynamics (Figure 2). In all experiments, the Ca2+ signal was recorded under the same settings (gain, digital offset) and in a pinhole with a maximum airy unit (15 AU, 13.5 µm cross-section) [32,33].\n",

The non-ﬂuorescent substance DCFH- DA is incorporated by cells through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, the substance is deacetylated by esterases and cannot pass the cell membrane anymore. DCFH reacts with ROS like hydroxyl or peroxyl. Through the oxidation process 2, 7-dichloroﬂuorescein (DCF), which is highly ﬂuorescent, is generated [34].\n",

      "102 NarrativeText The electric ﬁeld strength and its magnitude between the electrodes can be seen in Figure 3. Between the electrodes, where the cells are placed, is a large region with a more or less homogeneous ﬁeld. Only close to the electrode edges a ﬁeld enhancement can be observed (Figure 3a). However, the area with an enhanced ﬁeld is small in comparison to the area with a more or less constant ﬁeld strength. Along the centerline of the well, the ﬁeld decreases from 91.7 V/m at the electrodes to 90.2 V/m precisely at the midpoint between the electrodes (Figure 3b). Under the assumption of inﬁnitely wide capacitor plates, the ﬁeld could also be analytically estimated. In this case, it would be equal to the voltage difference over the electrode spacing. At a voltage difference of 1 V and a spacing of 1.1 cm, this corresponds to 90.91 V/m. It is of great interest to validate the numerical model. Since neither the electric ﬁeld nor the electric potential in the well can be measured easily, the current through the electrode needs to be compared. The current equals the conductivity times the normal component of the electric ﬁeld integrated over the electrode surface, yielding 1.75 A/m for the 2D geometry. With a 1 mL cell culture medium, a ﬁll level of 3.4 mm is reached. It should be noted that capillary effects are not considered here. Then, the current is 5.95 mA for 1 S/m conductivity and scales linearly with the conductivity. Consequently, it would be 11.9 mA for 2 S/m and so on.\n",

The grey isolines highlight the regions where the ﬁeld reaches 80, 90, and 100 V/m (the latter in the vicinity of the electrodes’ sharp corners), respectively. Furthermore, (b) shows the electric ﬁeld strength along the centerline between the two electrodes. The result indicates that the cells are exerted to a mostly homogeneous ﬁeld with a magnitude of about 90 V/m. Note that for different voltage differences, the ﬁeld strength changes linearly w.r.t. the voltage.\n",

Therefore, we ﬁrst analyzed the immediate effect of AC stimulation on the Ca2+ level of ﬂuo-3-stained MG-63s. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI of Ca2+- signal) within 10 min AC stimulation of MG-63s is given in Figure 8. The AC electric ﬁeld activated the cells, and the level of calcium ions increased signiﬁcantly independent of the stimulation parameters used, but obviously with 20 Hz (1 V: 85.8 ± 0.2; 5 V: 90.1 ± 0.2; MFI mean ± s.e.m.) compared to the Control (78.5 ± 0.2; MFI mean ± s.e.m.).\n",

Figure 9 presents the time course of the intracellular Ca2+ signal of MG-63s immediately after ES. The basal intracellular Ca2+ ion level (time frame 0–179 s) is enhanced 1.2 times in cells that were pre-stimulated with the higher frequency of 20 Hz (Figure 9a). After an additional stimulus with the energy-rich molecule ATP at 180 s, the Ca2+ ions were mobilized signiﬁcantly in these cells with a strong slope and a plateau phase (Figure 9a). The Ca2+ level after ATP increased signiﬁcantly for AC pre-stimulated cells with the settings 5 V_20 Hz, 1 V_20 Hz, 5 V_7.9 Hz with MFI values of 164.9 ± 10.23, 178.2 ± 9.5,\n",

These experiments were carried out in a calcium-containing medium. To solve the question of whether ES directly mobilizes the Ca2+ ions from internal stores during the period 0–179 s or if we observe an inﬂux of Ca2+ via the cell membrane, we used a calcium-free medium [36].

Therefore, the inﬂuence of AC electrical stimulation on cell morphology and spreading behavior was observed. Cells were 10 min AC-stimulated, and then the cell areas were analyzed after 0.5, 4, and 24 h (Figure 10). With our AC stimulation using different parameter settings, we could not identify any changes in cell morphology compared to unstimulated cells (Control) (Figure 10a). The ES neither hampered nor signiﬁcantly increased the spreading behavior (Figure 10b). A slight tendency of an increased cell area can be seen in 1 V_20 Hz cells after 4 and 24 h compared to Controls (Figure 10b).

Figure 11a shows a signiﬁ- cant increase of the ROS level directly after 5 V_7.9 Hz stimulation (mean ﬂuorescence: 1412 ± 273) compared to the Control (mean ﬂuorescence: 935 ± 151) as well as all other AC-stimulated MG-63s. This increased ROS production at 5 V_7.9 Hz was still signiﬁcant after 0.5 h (mean ﬂuorescence 0.5 h: 955 ± 92) (Figure 11b) but negligible after 4 h (median ﬂuorescence 4 h: 1277 ± 267) compared to Control (mean ﬂuorescence 4 h: 964 ± 147) (Figure 11c). An increase of one ROS species—H2O2—had also been detectable in the liquid stimulated with 5 V_7.9 Hz within the ﬁrst minutes (see Section 3.2, Figure 5). After 4 h, however, the H2O2 concentrations in the media were approximately the same.\n",

      "217 NarrativeText Nevertheless, from the 4 h time point, a signiﬁcant increase in ROS production in MG-63s was detectable with 10 min of 1 V_20 Hz stimulation (mean ﬂuorescence 4 h: 1381 ± 96) (Figure 11c). However, after 24 h, all ROS levels were comparable to the Control (mean ﬂuorescence 24 h: 2029 ± 223), only among each other, a signiﬁcant increase in ROS level in MG-63s under 1 V_20 Hz stimulation (mean ﬂuorescence 24 h: 2496 ± 145) comparable to all other AC stimulations could be observed (Figure 11d). The fact that the overall intracellular ROS level is 2-fold higher after 24 h compared to the earlier time points can be explained by the doubling of cell numbers [38].\n",

      "219 ListItem 4. Discussion\n",
      "220 NarrativeText Electrical stimulation (ES) plays a role in physiological processes in various tissues such as nerves, heart, cartilage, muscles [39], and bone [1,2,5,38]. Therefore, exogenous ES is a popular and successful adjunct therapy in vitro as well as in vivo for bone regen- eration [39–45]. In the present study, we investigated the response of human osteoblasts (MG-63s) to 10 min ES by the multi-channel electrical stimulator of IonOptix (C-PACE EM) when seeding directly in the 12-well C-Dish chamber. The purpose of this study is threefold: (i) characterizing the electric ﬁelds; (ii) the inﬂuence of ES (AC) on liquid characteristics (DMEM); and (iii) inﬂuence of ES (AC) on the initial cell adhesion and calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling of MG-63s. ES generated by IonOptix is described in studies with, e.g., myoblasts [46], or osteoblasts [12,14]. Ercan et al. [12], showed a positive effect\n",

      "223 NarrativeText of IonOptix AC stimulation on osteoblast (hFOB 1.19) proliferation, but they technically modiﬁed the system with potentiometers to achieve a physiological current. In general, the comparability and interpretation of studies are very challenging due to the use of different systems (mostly homemade), type of ES, electrode conﬁguration, experimental timeline, stimulation parameters, and hence the resulting electric ﬁelds, or the absence of essential data [5,24,40,47]. Budde et al. [24], published a study to draw attention to these misunderstandings and to explain which documentation is necessary for in vitro experiments, such as detailed information about electrical devices, electrode material, and experimental setups like waveform or exposure duration. Simulations could then be used to identify and explain parameters that affect the physiology of the cells [24]. However, the optimal ES parameters and the underlying mechanism are still unclear concerning the impact of cell behavior [5].\n",
      "224 NarrativeText In the ﬁrst part, we characterized the C-Dish chamber and the generated electric ﬁelds. The electric ﬁeld is generated between two parallel graphite plates (i.e., a plate capacitor) 1.1 cm apart and in direct contact with the cells. We utilized a commercially available device from IonOptix (voltage controlled), which has been described earlier [12,14,46]. The IonOptix stimulator generates AC electric ﬁelds with constant biphasic rectangular pulses at a frequency of 7.9 or 20 Hz and voltage of 1 and 5 V, respectively.\n",
      "225 NarrativeText The electric ﬁeld (distribution and strength) depends on the electrode shape, its material, the surrounding media, and the type of ES. The simulation reveals a homogeneous ﬁeld strength of 90 V/m at 1 V with our C-Dish chamber. The system can be assumed to be linear. Thus, the ﬁeld should be about 450 V/m at 5 V. To prove this assumption, we measured the current at different voltages. Indeed, the current scales by about 5.6 when the voltage is increased by 5. Although this is not perfectly linear, it shows that the assumption of linearity is applicable.\n",
      "226 NarrativeText The current through the medium can be considered to validate the simulation and hence the correctness of the estimated ﬁeld [23]. We measured a current of 12 mA at 1V input amplitude. However, the simulations predicted a current of 7.7 mA using the measured conductivity of the cell culture medium (1.3 S/m). This deviation is unexpected but requires further analysis to identify possible reasons. For example, charging and discharging effects due to the capacitive electrode–electrolyte interface could change the shape of the current pulse. Possibilities to quantify the capacitive behavior are, for example, described in [23], but have not yet been implemented for the considered system. Other reasons could be measurement errors of the conductivity or the capillary effect in the dish, which has not been considered in the model.\n",
      "227 NarrativeText Moreover, direct current (DC) can damage host tissues due to electrochemical reactions such as local pH increase [43], oxygen reduction, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation, as well as the formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS; such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl) [5,15,44,48]. Electrochemical reactions such as corrosion phenomena due to the electrode material can also be prevented with graphene electrodes [15,42,49]. Furthermore, the use of AC, instead of DC, and further the pulsed ES prevents ion and protein accumulation near the electrodes [5,50], as well as the indirect effects like a pH increase [5,14,42,51].\n",
      "228 NarrativeText For optimal growth of cells in vitro, we monitored pH, temperature, O2−, and H2O2 concentration of an acellular medium under ES in the present study. We could not detect any effects on pH and oxygen concentration in our AC-stimulated DMEM. Likewise, Ercan et al. [14], also found no signiﬁcant change in the medium, both pH and temperature, after 1 h of ES (IonOptix, 1 V_20 Hz). However, we detected a slight temperature increase of 1.4 ◦C at 7.9 Hz and 1.6 ◦C at 20 Hz in the medium during AC stimulation at 5 V. This is consistent with a simple estimate based on the electric energy deposited into each well during stimulation (~10 J), particularly when considering thermal losses to the environment. For 1 V AC stimulation, the medium temperature increased continuously by about 0.6 ◦C every 5 min. Reissis et al. [52], demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) retain their morphology, metabolic activity, and viability when exposed to temperatures ranging\n",

Our in vitro results conﬁrmed this assumption, as no morphological and growth impairment of MG-63s was detectable for all parameters after 10 min AC stimulation.\n",
      "232 NarrativeText The H2O2 concentration in the medium increased signiﬁcantly solely after stimulation with 5 V_7.9 Hz (2.52 µM). Srirussamee et al. [53], found H2O2 concentrations of acellular medium to be approximately 5 µM after two hours of DC stimulation. They applied the stimulated media to their cell culture, and the metabolic activity decreased in macrophages but not in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts compared to the unstimulated Control. When ES was applied directly to the cells, all stimulated cells showed decreased metabolic activity [53]. An extracellular H2O2 concentration above 10 µM was described to lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage [54]. As we did not measure such high concentrations after ES, adverse effects through H2O2 are unlikely. Srirussamee et al. [53], suggested that the inﬂuence of other faradic byproducts in the media contributes to decreased metabolic activity after incubation with the stimulated medium. We hypothesized that the overall decline of H2O2 over 24 h may occur due to incubation at a 5% CO2 atmosphere in the incubator and consequently changed pH. The pH values of freshly opened medium and medium incubated for 24 h at standard culture conditions were unaltered. Only medium which had been open for several days at atmospheric CO2 pressure showed increased pH values which might correlate to increased H2O2 concentrations before incubation. The oxygen content in the media did not inﬂuence the H2O2 concentration (data not shown).\n",
      "233 NarrativeText Similar to Srirussamee et al. [53], we applied the 10 min AC-stimulated acellular medium to our cell culture and found no effect on osteoblast adhesion, spreading, and growth within the ﬁrst 24 h. We expected an effect because, e.g., another physical modiﬁcation—a 60 s physical plasma treatment (Argon-plasma jet kINPen09) of the liquid DMEM—signiﬁcantly affected cell vitality, microvilli, and tight junction formation [37]. Due to only minor changes in the temperature, but not for pH and oxygen content in the AC-stimulated medium, we can exclude this as a reason for the altered cell behavior. Balint et al. [43], also postulated that an inﬂuence of the surrounding medium on cell behavior can be excluded and that cells respond directly to the electric ﬁeld. Electric ﬁelds are apparently sensed through the same pathways observed in mechanotransduction and chemotaxis [43]. Different cell types (like hMSC and osteoblasts) have been found to respond to various experimental ES conditions with altered cellular behaviors such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and directed migration due to effects on signaling pathways [8,39,55]. A positive impact can only be achieved if the type of ES parameters such as intensity, frequency, and duration of electric ﬁeld were well chosen [5,39,40,42]. Our ES parameters were chosen from the literature, where positive inﬂuence on osteoblasts has already been reported [12,14,56]. Ercan et al. [12], found that an optimal voltage window for maximizing osteoblast density on nanotubular titanium is 1 V to 15 V and 20 Hz (IonOptix). In the study of Aaron et al. [50], electric ﬁeld amplitudes in the range of 10–1000 V/m were identiﬁed as sufﬁcient to achieve an effect without cell damage; we are also within this range.\n",
      "234 NarrativeText In our third part of the study, we demonstrated that cell adhesion was increased by 10 min ES, independent of AC-stimulation parameters. Enhanced cell attachment to surfaces due to ES has already been described in some studies [57–59]. Dubey et al. [60], showed that a 2 V pulsed ES strongly promoted the adhesion of L929 ﬁbroblasts, whereas, at 25 V, the cells died. It is also described that, among others, ES inﬂuences the arrangement and density of adhesion receptors—integrins [41,61,62], or focal adhesion [63] such as vinculin [58,64]. In the subsequent studies, we also plan to examine integrin activation, such as ß1 integrin (9EG7), to conﬁrm cell adhesion receptors’ involvement.\n",
      "235 NarrativeText Cell attachment could inﬂuence cell behavior like cell signaling. We detected increased basal Ca2+ activity for settling cells under ES. However, the effect of ES on Ca2+ mobiliza- tion was dependent on frequencies and voltages: while at 1 V_7.9 Hz, reduced tendency was evident, all other ES parameters showed a signiﬁcantly increased Ca2+ response after adenosine triphosphate (ATP) addition. Note that trypsinization of cells affects the calcium\n",

      "238 NarrativeText response after ATP addition [65], but we accept the systematic error in analyzing calcium signaling during and immediately after 10 min AC stimulation. A 10 min stimulation of 24 h adherent cells indicated no effect on calcium response, either basal or after ATP addition (data not shown). Many studies report that cells are sensitive to ES through activation of ion channels in the cell membrane, and release of Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [8,13,15,39,42,43,45,57,66,67]. For exam- ple, Khatib et al. [68] described an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in human osteoblasts after 20 min of DC stimulation at 2 V/cm due to an inﬂux of extracellular Ca2+ through stretch-activated cation channels (SACC), a release from intracellular stores, as well as activation of phospholipase C (PLC). We primarily suspect an enhanced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, as we observe a strong response of cells by the addition of ATP, which activates the PLC pathway via G-protein coupled receptor, and ﬁnally re- leases Ca2+ from the ER [30]. Extracellular Ca2+ inﬂux via ion channels is of secondary importance in our short 10 min stimulation, as analyses without extracellular Ca2+ sources from the HEPES buffer [36], also demonstrated an increased basal Ca2+ level in MG-63s in all ES parameters (data not shown). Zhou et al. [69], demonstrated that the intake of extracellular Ca2+ plays a decisive role in the increased calcium mobilization in MG-63s during nanosecond pulsed electric ﬁeld stimulation.\n",
      "239 NarrativeText In addition to Ca2+ signaling, many other cellular mechanisms, e.g., redox stress, are discussed to contribute to the effects of ES. Since direct ES stimulation at 5 V_7.9 Hz resulted in the generation of H2O2 in the acellular medium, we found the production of intracellular ROS in MG-63s within the ﬁrst minutes to rise accordingly, which was then equalized to the level of the unstimulated Control after 4 h. Wu et al. [70] described a linear relationship between ﬁeld strength and intracellular ROS production. However, the ﬁeld strength alone could not be causative in our case, as an increase in intracellular ROS was detectable at 5 V_7.9 Hz but not at 5 V_20 Hz. However, from 4 h, there was an increase in intracellular ROS level at 1 V_20 Hz, suggesting that a signaling pathway was turned on by ES, like Ca2+ signaling. At 1 V_20 Hz, we also had the strongest Ca2+ release in response to ATP addition. Thus, Görlach et al. [21] postulated that Ca2+ and ROS signaling are inter-regulated and crucial for cell signaling. Diaz-Vegas et al. [71] found the production of intracellular ROS after ES in muscle ﬁbers to be dependent on NOX2 activity. They found extracellular ATP to contribute to ROS production via P2Y1 receptors, also crosslinking Ca- and ROS-signaling. Studies indicated that intracellular ROS production could be increased by ES, acting as a signal transducer in physiological as well as pathological processes [15,57,72]. A 1.3-fold increase of ROS level in MG-63s at 1 V_20 Hz AC stimulation, compared to the Control (24 h), could be suggestive of a physiological level, according to our results, which triggers Ca2+ signaling. In contrast, the positive check (H2O2) showed a 6.4-fold increase in ROS production, leading to cell detachment and thus to a pathological process.\n",
      "240 NarrativeText Sun et al. [67] demonstrated that alteration of ion gradients or cell surface charges by an applied electric ﬁeld resulted in changes in Ca2+ signaling and subsequently increased gene expression of Col I & ALP but had no effect on hMSC growth rate or morphology. We also demonstrated the unaltered morphology of MG-63s under 10 min ES in FE-SEM images within 24 h. Furthermore, Sahm et al. [73] revealed in human primary osteoblast no altered proliferation and viability within 7 d AC stimulation on Ti6Al4V surfaces. Many studies describe improved cell survival and promote osseointegration (such synthesis of Collagen I) by ES [5,39,42,43,51,55,56,64,67]. Stimulation of osteoblasts with pulsed ES increased the calcium deposition after 3 weeks [14]. Furthermore, pulsed ES increased collagen production in pre-osteoblasts [5], demonstrating that pulsed stimulation can increase bone matrix deposition.\n",
      "241 NarrativeText In this study, we have analyzed and validated a method for ES stimulation of os- teoblasts in vitro based on direct contact of AC electric ﬁelds.

      "247 NarrativeText Precisely characterizing the electric ﬁelds and their inﬂuence on the environment is crucial to comparing and evaluating in vitro stimulation studies. The liquid DMEM electrically stimulated with 1 V (7.9 and 20 Hz) did not change their pH, temperature, H2O2, and O2 content characteristics. Therefore, the AC-stimulated liquid alone did not inﬂuence the long-time MG-63 cell adhesion measured via impedance.\n",
      "248 NarrativeText In contrast, the AC stimulation of suspended cells positively inﬂuences initial cell adhesion processes. Due to ES, the cells were more active, and a higher basal level of Ca2+ ions was detectable.

      "A widespread research ﬁeld in regenerative medicine is electrical stimulation (ES), and its impact on tissue and cells, such as bone [1]. In 1957 the piezoelectric properties of bone were described [2]. As the bone healing process takes place under the mechanical strain of the bone [3], an electric ﬁeld is generated in the bone in vitro and in vivo [4]. Externally applied electric ﬁelds were shown to contribute to bone deposition and osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [5]. The living cell has a membrane potential that indicates the electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space, which is generated by the transport of ions through ion channels and ion transporters [6]. The membrane potential is always negative because of the higher negative ion concentration inside the cell [7,8]. Primary osteoblasts revealed a membrane potential of −60 mV [9], MG- 63 osteoblasts demonstrated a negatively charged cell surface of −15.6 mV [10]. Due to the appearance of ions and polar or charged molecules, cells can build up electrical ﬁelds or can respond to them [11,12]. If injuries appear on the bone, a wound potential, which should lead precursor cells to differentiation, will be generated [13]. A possible approach for the\n"

The mechanism of action of ES, particularly the role of electrical parameters like intensity, frequency, and duration of the electric ﬁeld, is not yet fully understood. Human MG-63 osteoblasts were electrically stimulated for 10 min with a commercially available multi-channel system (IonOptix). We generated alternating current (AC) electrical ﬁelds with a voltage of 1 or 5 V and frequencies of 7.9 or 20 Hz, respectively. To exclude liquid-mediated effects, we characterized the AC-stimulated culture medium. AC stimulation did not change the medium’s pH, temperature, and oxygen content. The H2O2 level was comparable with the unstimulated samples except at 5 V_7.9 Hz, where a signiﬁcant increase in H2O2 was found within the ﬁrst 30 min. Pulsed electrical stimulation was beneﬁcial for the process of attachment and initial adhesion of suspended osteoblasts. At the same time, the intracellular Ca2+ level was enhanced and highest for 20 Hz stimulated cells with 1 and 5 V, respectively. In addition, increased Ca2+ mobilization after an additional trigger (ATP) was detected at these parameters. New knowledge was provided on why electrical stimulation contributes to cell activation in bone tissue regeneration.'),\n",

In 1957 the piezoelectric properties of bone were described [2]. As the bone healing process takes place under the mechanical strain of the bone [3], an electric ﬁeld is generated in the bone in vitro and in vivo [4]. Externally applied electric ﬁelds were shown to contribute to bone deposition and osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [5]. The living cell has a membrane potential that indicates the electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space, which is generated by the transport of ions through ion channels and ion transporters [6]. The membrane potential is always negative because of the higher negative ion concentration inside the cell [7,8]. Primary osteoblasts revealed a membrane potential of −60 mV [9], MG- 63 osteoblasts demonstrated a negatively charged cell surface of −15.6 mV [10]. Due to the appearance of ions and polar or charged molecules, cells can build up electrical ﬁelds or can respond to them [11,12]. If injuries appear on the bone, a wound potential, which should lead precursor cells to differentiation, will be generated [13]. A possible approach for the'),\n",

In some publications, it is described that ES can manipulate different cell processes, for example, cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and differentiation [8,14]. Widespread methods of the ES for bone tissue are invasive methods like direct contact stimulation [14], in vitro, the electrically conductive electrodes are placed directly in the culture medium. The applied current streams from the anode to the cathode [15]. The modiﬁcation of the cell membrane potential through ES can activate different intracellular pathways. External electrical ﬁelds can generate an intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) ﬂow and consequently activate different pathways [16], such as wnt [17]. Ca2+ dynamics were identiﬁed as a sensitive parameter for cell physiological processes. Furthermore, the ES can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can control different cellular processes like proliferation and modulated signaling pathways [18,19]. When the equilibrium is destroyed, and the concentration of ROS is relatively high, cells suffer under oxidative stress. Moreover, Ca2+ signaling was shown to contribute to ROS generation through calmodulin [20], as well as ROS contributing to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations by altering calcium channels [21].'),\n",

For these cell experiments, solely the cell culture medium was stimulated in the IonOptix chamber and analyzed for pH, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide content.'),\n",

The electrodes consist of carbon in the graphite modiﬁcation and are shaped in a plate format (capacitor). The advantages of graphite are its excellent electrical conductivity and the high resistance against corrosion. The protein adsorption on the surface is problematic as it affects the electrical ﬁeld´s homogeneity. Therefore, a regular cleaning after use is necessary [22]. The electrodes can be sterilized by treatment with ethanol and ultraviolet light (UV).

Between the electrodes, where the cells are placed, is a large region with a more or less homogeneous ﬁeld. Only close to the electrode edges a ﬁeld enhancement can be observed (Figure 3a). However, the area with an enhanced ﬁeld is small in comparison to the area with a more or less constant ﬁeld strength. Along the centerline of the well, the ﬁeld decreases from 91.7 V/m at the electrodes to 90.2 V/m precisely at the midpoint between the electrodes (Figure 3b). Under the assumption of inﬁnitely wide capacitor plates, the ﬁeld could also be analytically estimated. In this case, it would be equal to the voltage difference over the electrode spacing. At a voltage difference of 1 V and a spacing of 1.1 cm, this corresponds to 90.91 V/m. It is of great interest to validate the numerical model. Since neither the electric ﬁeld nor the electric potential in the well can be measured easily, the current through the electrode needs to be compared. The current equals the conductivity times the normal component of the electric ﬁeld integrated over the electrode surface, yielding 1.75 A/m for the 2D geometry. With a 1 mL cell culture medium, a ﬁll level of 3.4 mm is reached. It should be noted that capillary effects are not considered here. Then, the current is 5.95 mA for 1 S/m conductivity and scales linearly with the conductivity. Consequently, it would be 11.9 mA for 2 S/m and so on.'),\n",

[53], we applied the 10 min AC-stimulated acellular medium to our cell culture and found no effect on osteoblast adhesion, spreading, and growth within the ﬁrst 24 h. We expected an effect because, e.g., another physical modiﬁcation—a 60 s physical plasma treatment (Argon-plasma jet kINPen09) of the liquid DMEM—signiﬁcantly affected cell vitality, microvilli, and tight junction formation [37]. Due to only minor changes in the temperature, but not for pH and oxygen content in the AC-stimulated medium, we can exclude this as a reason for the altered cell behavior. Balint et al. [43], also postulated that an inﬂuence of the surrounding medium on cell behavior can be excluded and that cells respond directly to the electric ﬁeld. Electric ﬁelds are apparently sensed through the same pathways observed in mechanotransduction and chemotaxis [43]. Different cell types (like hMSC and osteoblasts) have been found to respond to various experimental ES conditions with altered cellular behaviors such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and directed migration due to effects on signaling pathways [8,39,55]. A positive impact can only be achieved if the type of ES parameters such as intensity, frequency, and duration of electric ﬁeld were well chosen [5,39,40,42].

A 10 min stimulation of 24 h adherent cells indicated no effect on calcium response, either basal or after ATP addition (data not shown). Many studies report that cells are sensitive to ES through activation of ion channels in the cell membrane, and release of Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [8,13,15,39,42,43,45,57,66,67]. For exam- ple, Khatib et al. [68] described an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in human osteoblasts after 20 min of DC stimulation at 2 V/cm due to an inﬂux of extracellular Ca2+ through stretch-activated cation channels (SACC), a release from intracellular stores, as well as activation of phospholipase C (PLC). We primarily suspect an enhanced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, as we observe a strong response of cells by the addition of ATP, which activates the PLC pathway via G-protein coupled receptor, and ﬁnally re- leases Ca2+ from the ER [30]. Extracellular Ca2+ inﬂux via ion channels is of secondary importance in our short 10 min stimulation, as analyses without extracellular Ca2+ sources from the HEPES buffer [36], also demonstrated an increased basal Ca2+ level in MG-63s in all ES parameters (data not shown). Zhou et al. [69], demonstrated that the intake of extracellular Ca2+ plays a decisive role in the increased calcium mobilization in MG-63s during nanosecond pulsed electric ﬁeld stimulation.'),\n",

Since direct ES stimulation at 5 V_7.9 Hz resulted in the generation of H2O2 in the acellular medium, we found the production of intracellular ROS in MG-63s within the ﬁrst minutes to rise accordingly, which was then equalized to the level of the unstimulated Control after 4 h. Wu et al. [70] described a linear relationship between ﬁeld strength and intracellular ROS production. However, the ﬁeld strength alone could not be causative in our case, as an increase in intracellular ROS was detectable at 5 V_7.9 Hz but not at 5 V_20 Hz. However, from 4 h, there was an increase in intracellular ROS level at 1 V_20 Hz, suggesting that a signaling pathway was turned on by ES, like Ca2+ signaling. At 1 V_20 Hz, we also had the strongest Ca2+ release in response to ATP addition. Thus, Görlach et al. [21] postulated that Ca2+ and ROS signaling are inter-regulated and crucial for cell signaling. Diaz-Vegas et al. [71] found the production of intracellular ROS after ES in muscle ﬁbers to be dependent on NOX2 activity. They found extracellular ATP to contribute to ROS production via P2Y1 receptors, also crosslinking Ca- and ROS-signaling. Studies indicated that intracellular ROS production could be increased by ES, acting as a signal transducer in physiological as well as pathological processes [15,57,72]. A 1.3-fold increase of ROS level in MG-63s at 1 V_20 Hz AC stimulation, compared to the Control (24 h), could be suggestive of a physiological level, according to our results, which triggers Ca2+ signaling. In contrast, the positive check (H2O2) showed a 6.4-fold increase in ROS production, leading to cell detachment and thus to a pathological process.'),\n",
