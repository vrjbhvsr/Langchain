    "### 🔶 What is Structure Output?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually, when we get the output in the chat(from LLM) is appearing in term of text, meaning it's not stored in specific format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structured Output is the LLM output that is in well-defined data format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This help, when we send our output to another LLM to perform related task. In agentic AI, The output of an LLM can be input of the another LLM to solve the task, this case is a very good example of why we need output in specific structured format\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Structured output allows agents to return data in a specific, predictable format. Instead of parsing natural language responses, you get structured data in the form of JSON objects, Pydantic models, or dataclasses that your application can directly use. -LangchainDocs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔶 Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Extraction - When we need to store the output of the LLM into database, such as candidates information from the resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Knowledge graph or Scene Graph creation - to connect nodes to edges in scene graph, structured output helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multi-Agent communications\n",
    "\n",
    "4. function or tool calling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔵 Some LLM providers can respond in structured format, and some cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Well, According to LangchainDocs they have specifically focused on create_agent class which include `response_format` parameter. I will understand from the perspective of both standalone LLMs and agents. Basically they both follow the same strategy, we just have to add that strategy to `response_format= strategy` for agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When a schema type is provided directly, LangChain automatically chooses `ProviderStrategy` for models supporting native structured output (e.g. OpenAI, Grok), `ToolStrategy` for all other models"

      "content=\" Hello! I'd be happy to share some recent updates in the AI world. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and the AI field evolves rapidly:\\n\\n1. **ChatGPT (December 2022)**: Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a model that interacts in a conversational way. It provides responses to a wide range of prompts with a text-based interface. It has gained significant attention due to its ability to answer questions, write essays, summarize books, and more.\\n\\n2. **Google's Bard (February 2023)**: Google's response to ChatGPT, Bard, is a conversational AI model that aims to provide detailed and high-quality responses to a wide range of questions. It's still in the early stages of development and testing.\\n\\n3. **Stable Diffusion Models (SDMs) (2022)**: SDMs are a class of generative models that have shown promising results in image synthesis and text-to-image generation. They are an alternative to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and have the potential to improve the quality and stability of generated content.\\n\\n4. **Hugging Face's Model Hub (2021)**: Hugging Face launched Model Hub, a platform for sharing and discovering pre-trained AI models. This resource is valuable for developers who want to leverage existing models for their projects without having to train their own.\\n\\n5. **Ethical AI Guidelines**: Various organizations, including the European Union, have been working on developing guidelines for ethical AI. These guidelines aim to ensure that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and respect user privacy and rights.\\n\\n6. **AI in Healthcare**: AI is increasingly being used in healthcare for tasks such as diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and personalizing treatment plans. For example, Google's DeepMind Health is collaborating with the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK to develop AI tools for healthcare.\\n\\n7. **AI in Climate Change**: AI is being used to analyze vast amounts of data related to climate change, helping scientists better understand the impacts of climate change and develop strategies to mitigate its effects. For example, IBM's Watson is being used to analyze satellite data to monitor deforestation and track the effects of climate change on ecosystems.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 520, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 535}, 'model_name': 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--f43776c2-1719-4c70-9ca0-f5acdf7e06af-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 520, 'total_tokens': 535}\n"
