    "#### 🔹 Limitation of Fixed Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "System prompts defined at the beginning of a session remain constant throughout the interaction. This restricts the model’s ability to adapt to new personality, tasks, tones, or contextual changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we set the system prompt as “You are a Creative Idea Generator,” the model will continue responding from that perspective across all queries. Consequently, if we later require analytical or mathematically detailed answers instead of purely theoretical or creative ones, we would need to manually modify the system prompt each time—an impractical approach for dynamic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 🔹 Need for Dynamic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this limitation, dynamic prompting is introduced. It allows selective modification of certain parts of the prompt based on the current context, user intent, or task type, while keeping the core instruction stable. This enables the model to generate responses that are more relevant, adaptive, and task-specific without requiring constant manual prompt adjustments.Those prompt are defined in very beginning, thst sre fixed. So, it limits the model to adapt with new topic, task, tone and related content.\n"
