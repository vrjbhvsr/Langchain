A widespread research field in regenerative medicine is electrical stimulation (ES),
and its impact on tissue and cells, such as bone [1]. In 1957 the piezoelectric properties of
bone were described [2]. As the bone healing process takes place under the mechanical
strain of the bone [3], an electric field is generated in the bone in vitro and in vivo [4].
Externally applied electric fields were shown to contribute to bone deposition and osteoblast
differentiation and proliferation [5]. The living cell has a membrane potential that indicates
the electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space, which
is generated by the transport of ions through ion channels and ion transporters [6]. The
membrane potential is always negative because of the higher negative ion concentration
inside the cell [7,8]. Primary osteoblasts revealed a membrane potential of −60 mV [9], MG-
63 osteoblasts demonstrated a negatively charged cell surface of −15.6 mV [10]. Due to the
appearance of ions and polar or charged molecules, cells can build up electrical fields or can
respond to them [11,12]. If injuries appear on the bone, a wound potential, which should
lead precursor cells to differentiation, will be generated [13]. A possible approach for the
therapy is through electrical stimulation to accelerate bone healing. In some publications,
it is described that ES can manipulate different cell processes, for example, cell adhesion,
proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and differentiation [8,14]. Widespread methods of
the ES for bone tissue are invasive methods like direct contact stimulation [14], in vitro,
the electrically conductive electrodes are placed directly in the culture medium. The
applied current streams from the anode to the cathode [15]. The modification of the cell
membrane potential through ES can activate different intracellular pathways. External
electrical fields can generate an intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) flow and consequently
activate different pathways [16], such as wnt [17]. Ca2+ dynamics were identified as a
sensitive parameter for cell physiological processes. Furthermore, the ES can stimulate the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can control different cellular processes
like proliferation and modulated signaling pathways [18,19]. When the equilibrium is
destroyed, and the concentration of ROS is relatively high, cells suffer under oxidative
stress. Moreover, Ca2+ signaling was shown to contribute to ROS generation through
calmodulin [20], as well as ROS contributing to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations
by altering calcium channels [21].
It was described that the electric field could modulate cell functions in order to
accelerate wound healing and bone regeneration [5,12,14]. In contrast to previous studies,
we are focusing on the influence of a short alternating current (AC)-stimulation time on
settling cells via a commercial device (IonOptix) with the following parameters: rectangular
waveform, voltages of ±1 or ±5 V, frequency of 7.9 Hz with pulse duration of 10 ms, or
20 Hz with pulse duration of 3.6 ms. In vitro, cell processes such as intracellular Ca2+ level
and mobilization, adhesion, and morphology of human osteoblasts within 24 h were studied
to understand the effect of ES on osteoblast behavior. In addition, we wanted to shed light
on the question of whether ES affects the cells via liquids, i.e., AC-pre-conditioned medium.
For these cell experiments, solely the cell culture medium was stimulated in the IonOptix
chamber and analyzed for pH, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide content.
